Project Mirage is a unique endeavour where talented developers from GDSC MPSTME work together to create a web application without direct communication, fostering an environment of uncertainty, surprise, and innovation.

As the project progresses, the mirage will lift and the big picture will come into focus. What creative solutions will emerge from this mystery development process? What ingenious features will our developers dream up while flying solo? The suspense is exhilarating!
